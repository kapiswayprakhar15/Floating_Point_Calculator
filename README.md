# Floating_Point_Calculator

In a bespoke format, add, subtract, or multiply two floating point numbers.


Floating point number format:
The format and IEEE 754 format are extremely similar. The first bit of the 32-bit floating-point number is set aside as the sign-bit. The following 12 bits are used for exponents in the format of the 2's complement, while the remaining 19 bits are used for the mantissa in its normalised form.

The memory contains the finished product.
